1YARN
In this tutorial, we will use MapReduce examples to learn how to work with Apache YARN.

1.1The MapReduce examples
The samples are located on the Hortonworks Data Platform cluster at:
   /usr/odp/current/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-examples.jar
Source code for these samples is included on the ODP cluster at:
      /usr/odp/current/hadoop-client/src/hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-mapreduce-examples

The following samples are contained in this archive:

Sample	Description
aggregatewordcount	Counts the words in the input files.
aggregatewordhist	Computes the histogram of the words in the input files. bbp	Uses Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe to compute exact digits of Pi.
dbcount	Counts the pageview logs stored in a database.
distbbp	Uses a BBP-type formula to compute exact bits of Pi.
grep	Counts the matches of a regex in the input.
join	Performs a join over sorted, equally partitioned datasets.
multifilewc	Counts words from several files.
pentomino	Tile laying program to find solutions to pentomino problems. pi	Estimates Pi using a quasi-Monte Carlo method. randomtextwriter	Writes 10 GB of random  textual  data  per  node. randomwriter	Writes 10 GB of random data per node.
secondarysort	Defines a secondary sort to the reduce phase. sort	Sorts the data written by the random writer.
sudoku	A sudoku solver.
teragen	Generate data for the terasort.
terasort	Run the terasort.
teravalidate	Checking results of terasort.
wordcount	Counts the words in the input files.
wordmean	Counts the average length of the words in the input files. wordmedian	Counts the median length of the words in the input files.
wordstandarddeviation	Counts the standard deviation of the length of the words in the input files.

1.2Run the wordcount example
       Connect to HADOOP cluster using SSH.
       From the SSH session, use the following command to list the samples:
$   yarn jar /usr/odp/current/hadoop-mapreduce-client /hadoop-mapreduce-examples .jar
